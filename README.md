## Project Brief

At KCL and other universities, societies typically host events that require the purchase of tickets. This allows the society to make sure their event can facilitate a certain number of people, or they can limit the capacity. There are various external ticket-selling services, but these typically take a large cut of the ticket sale price (sometimes as high as 40%). The proposed software should be a free alternative that societies can use in order to easily sell tickets to students without having to lose a lot of money. The software should allow different societies to set up an account and create events for which they want to sell tickets. Students should be able to use the software to view events and buy tickets. Payments can be made via third-party payment gateways such as PayPal.
