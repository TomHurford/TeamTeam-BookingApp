    As the president of a society, you have access to a range of tools to help you manage your organization. You can assign and remove committee members, edit society and event pages, and see other committee members. If you want to give your role to another user, you can do so at any time. 
    <br />
    <br />
    Committee members have many of the same privileges as the president, but they cannot assign or remove other committee members or pass on roles.
